# Xibalba

A maya mitológiában az alvilág urának/urainak neve. Másutt, John Major Jenkins-nél specifikusan a Tejúthasadék (lásd [[Galactic centre]]) neve, az ott sötéttel jelzett rész (dark rift).  
Siv-Al-Va/Ba, Szép/Csíp-Al-Va formákban magyarítható.  

Wikipedia anyag:  
> In the Postclassic [[Popol Vuh|Popul Vuh]] of the K'iche' Maya of highland Guatemala, dogs and turkeys killed the people of the second age in retaliation for the people beating them. The people who escaped this fate were transformed into monkeys. Another account in the Popol Vuh describes the Hero twins sacrificing a dog that belonged to the Lords of the Underworld, also known as **Xibalba**. After the dog was dead, the Hero Twins brought it back to life. The Lords were so impressed that they asked the twins to sacrifice and resurrect them. In the end, the Hero Twins sacrificed the Lords of Xibalba and did not follow through on bringing them back to life. This made it possible for humans to live on earth. The story linked dogs with renewal and human life. Dogs are associated with death and have the job of leading people into the Underworld. They represent fire and are protectors of the hearth, two components of Maya life.
